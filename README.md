# Northampton-News
Northampton News was an assignment giving during my second year at university.

The task was to write all the PHP necessary to make the website functional and work alongside a MySQL database to store and access
all the information.

We were not allowed to edit the CSS or HTML of the assignment and no JavaScript could be used.
