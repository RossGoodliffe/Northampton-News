# Northampton-News
Northampton News was an assignment giving during my second year at university.

The task was to write all the PHP necessary to make the website functional and work alongside a MySQL database to store and access
all the information.

We were not allowed to edit the CSS or HTML of the assignment and no JavaScript could be used.

There is currently no live version available for this as this was developed on a local device using Vagrant. 
However to view a demonstration of the working project please [click here](https://www.google.com) to be redirected.
